Welcome to the Mint blog. I am very excited to share my work as open source. I have spent hundreds of weekends on the 
first release. Here I want to share, what is Mint stack and why I built this.

<!--truncate-->

I wanted to solve some problems that I personally faced. I am pretty sure a lot of you guys must have faced the
same issue. I wanted a boilerplate which had up-to-date stuff and followed good coding practices.

I wanted to have a starter kit with essential things offered out-of-the-box. I don't want to spend my time on the
repetitive things. Working on the same thing, writing the same stuff again and again makes the overall experience
boring.

I am sure that you will love the Mint stack ‚ù§ and it will help you start your projects with offered features.
